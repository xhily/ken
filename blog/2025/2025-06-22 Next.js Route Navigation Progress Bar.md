Hello, I'm Kaypen.

Let's start with a bad example.

In Dify.ai, when you click to navigate to another page, there's a waiting period before the page actually transitions.

![Dify.ai lacks progress feedback during page navigation](https://img.wukaipeng.com//2025/06/22-001014-b22Y3p-dify.gif)

However, during this waiting time, I don't know whether the navigation was successful or not, so I end up clicking multiple times until the page finally changes.

This is a poor user experience üëé

The solution is simple. Let's look at how GitHub handles navigation interactions.

![GitHub's progress bar effect during page navigation](https://img.wukaipeng.com//2025/06/22-001027-wIEPR6-github.gif)

As you can see, GitHub displays a progress bar during navigation, clearly telling users - "I'm navigating, please wait."

So how can we implement this effect in Next.js?

We can achieve this using the [BProgress](https://bprogress.vercel.app/) library.

![BProgress official website homepage](https://img.wukaipeng.com//2025/06/22-001139-FNp34B-iShot_2025-06-22_00.11.25.jpg)

BProgress is a lightweight progress bar component library that supports Next.js 15+, as well as other frameworks like Remix and Vue.

For using BProgress, I've created a demo project [nextjs-progress-bar-demo](https://github.com/wukaipeng-dev/nextjs-progress-bar-demo). Let's clone this project first:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:wukaipeng-dev/nextjs-progress-bar-demo.git
```

Then enter the project directory:

```bash
cd nextjs-progress-bar-demo
```

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install @bprogress/next
```

Start the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

![Next.js progress bar demo project interface](https://img.wukaipeng.com//2025/06/22-001402-BiLNbr-image-20250622001402486.png)

As you can see, this is a simple Next.js project with three pages: Home, Login, and Register.

The `main` branch already has the progress bar configured. Let's switch to the `without-progress-bar-demo` branch:

```bash
git checkout without-progress-bar-demo
```

In this branch, we haven't configured the progress bar, so no progress bar will be displayed during page navigation.

Next, let's import `ProgressProvider` in the root layout `app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx {4,14-21}
'use client';

import "./globals.css";
import { ProgressProvider } from '@bprogress/next/app';

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <ProgressProvider
          height="4px"
          color="#4c3aed"
          options={{ showSpinner: false }}
          shallowRouting
          >
          {children}
        </ProgressProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Now, we can see that when navigating between the home page and login page, or between login and register pages, a progress bar will be displayed.

![Page navigation effect after integrating BProgress](https://img.wukaipeng.com//2025/06/22-001736-Lqx6xz-basic-integrate.gif)

The `ProgressProvider` parameters are:

- `height`: The height of the progress bar
- `color`: The color of the progress bar
- `options`: Progress bar configuration. Here `showSpinner` is set to `false`, meaning no animated loading icon will be displayed.
- `shallowRouting`: Whether to enable shallow routing. If enabled, when only the route's query parameters change (e.g., `?page=1` to `?page=2`), the progress bar won't reload.

However, after successful login, clicking to navigate won't show the progress bar.

![Progress bar not showing when using router.push](https://img.wukaipeng.com//2025/06/22-001924-LDl4LE-no-progress-when-login.gif)

This is because navigation between the home page and login page, or between login and register pages, uses the `<Link>` component.

The `<Link>` component actually renders as an `<a>` tag, and BProgress adds click events to all `<a>` components to show the progress bar.

We can check in DevTools ‚Üí Elements ‚Üí `<a>` ‚Üí Event Listeners whether a click event has been added:

![Viewing Link component's click event listeners in DevTools](https://img.wukaipeng.com//2025/06/22-002255-d9dYdk-iShot_2025-06-22_00.22.04.webp)

But after successful login, we use `router.push` for navigation.

BProgress doesn't add click events to `router.push`, so naturally it won't show a progress bar.

Don't worry, BProgress provides us with a `useRouter` method.

Replace Next.js's `useRouter` with the `useRouter` provided by BProgress:

```tsx
// import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { useRouter } from '@bprogress/next/app';
```

Then use it as normal:

```tsx
const router = useRouter();

router.push('/');
```

Now you can see that after successful login, when automatically navigating to the home page, the progress bar displays correctly.

![Progress bar displays correctly after using BProgress's useRouter](https://img.wukaipeng.com//2025/06/22-002512-FZVedD-show-progress-when-login.gif)

But if your project has already wrapped its own `useRouter`, you can pass the wrapped `useRouter` as a parameter `customRouter` for a second wrapping:

```tsx {6}
import { useRouter } from '@bprogress/next/app';
import { useRouter as useNextIntlRouter } from '@/i18n/navigation';

export default function Home() {
  const router = useRouter({
    customRouter: useNextIntlRouter,
  });

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        router.push('/about', {
          startPosition: 0.3,
          locale: 'en',
        })
      }
    >
      Go to about page
    </button>
  );
}
```

Finally, let's go back to `app/layout.tsx`, where we imported `ProgressProvider` but turned `app/layout` into a client component. Let's extract `ProgressProvider` elsewhere and keep `app/layout` as a server component.

```tsx
// app/components/ProgressWrapper.tsx
'use client';

import { ProgressProvider } from '@bprogress/next/app';

interface ProgressWrapperProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function ProgressWrapper({ children }: ProgressWrapperProps) {
  return (
    <ProgressProvider
      height="4px"
      color="#0000ff"
      options={{ showSpinner: false }}
      shallowRouting
    >
      {children}
    </ProgressProvider>
  );
}
```

In `app/layout.tsx`, we import `ProgressWrapper`:

```tsx
import { ProgressWrapper } from './components/ProgressWrapper';

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <ProgressWrapper>
          {children}
        </ProgressWrapper>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Great job! You've completed the integration of a route navigation progress bar in Next.js.

That's all for this tutorial. I hope you found it helpful.
