title: "Swapping Values Without Intermediate Variables"
---

Here are three methods to swap values without using intermediate variables.

## 1. Addition and Subtraction

Assume we have variables:

```js
let a = 2, b = 5
```

Swap:

```js
a = a + b // a = 7

b = a - b // b = 2

a = a - b // a = 5
```

Disadvantages:

- Can only handle numeric values
- May overflow when adding large numbers

## 2. Multiplication and Division

Since we have addition and subtraction, we can naturally think of multiplication and division:

```js
a = a * b // a = 10

b = a / b // b = 2

a = a / b // a = 5
```

Disadvantages:

- Precision loss
- Divisor cannot be 0

## 3. XOR Method

XOR is a mathematical operation where different values yield 1, same values yield 0:

|      |      | Result |
| ---- | ---- | ------ |
| 0    | 0    | 0      |
| 0    | 1    | 1      |
| 1    | 0    | 1      |
| 1    | 1    | 0      |

<br />

To perform XOR operations in computers, we need to convert values to binary first. `a` in binary is `010`, `b` in binary is `101`:

```js
a = a ^ b // 010 ^ 101 = 111

b = a ^ b // 111 ^ 101 = 010

a = a ^ b // 111 ^ 010 = 101
```

Disadvantages:

- Cannot handle floating-point variables

## Summary

All three methods are clever tricks, only for learning purposes. It's best not to use them in production environments.
