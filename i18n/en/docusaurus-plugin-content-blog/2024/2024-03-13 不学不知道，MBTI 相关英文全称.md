Let's learn about MBTI's English full forms through this article.

MBTI stands for **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator**.

| Word        | Letter | US Pronunciation | Chinese Meaning |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| **E**xtraversion | E      | [ˌɛkstrəˈvɜrʒən]      | 外向 (Extroverted) |
| **I**ntroversion | I      | [ˌɪntrəˈvɜrʒən]      | 内向 (Introverted) |
| **S**ensing     | S      | [ˈsɛnsɪŋ]      | 感觉 (Sensing) |
| **N**ntuition   | N      | [ˌnjuˈɪʃən]      | 直觉 (Intuition) |
| **T**hinking    | T      | [ˈθɪŋkɪŋ]      | 思考 (Thinking) |
| **F**eeling     | F      | [ˈfilɪŋ]      | 情感 (Feeling) |
| **J**udging     | J      | [ˈdʒʌdʒɪŋ]      | 判断 (Judging) |
| **P**erceiving  | P      | [pərˈsiːvɪŋ]      | 感知 (Perceiving) |

Each MBTI letter represents a specific personality trait, with traits paired: E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P:
- E/I: This pair represents the difference between **extraversion and introversion**. Extraverts enjoy socializing and activities, while introverts prefer solitude and reflection.
- S/N: This pair represents the difference between **sensing and intuition**. Sensing types prefer concrete and realistic things, while intuitive types prefer abstract and future-oriented concepts.
- T/F: This pair represents the difference between **thinking and feeling**. Thinking types prefer logic and analysis, while feeling types prefer values and relationships.
- J/P: This pair represents the difference between **judging and perceiving**. Judging types prefer planning and decision-making, while perceiving types prefer flexibility and observation.

Each personality trait has two possible values, so MBTI has a total of $2\times2\times2\times2=16$ personality types:
