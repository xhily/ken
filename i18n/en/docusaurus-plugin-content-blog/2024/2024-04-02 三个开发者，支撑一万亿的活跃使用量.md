title: Three Developers Supporting One Trillion Active Uses
---

For many developers, SQLite is certainly familiar.

We know it's powerful, but didn't expect it to be THIS powerful.

SQLite currently has over one trillion ($1e12$) active uses.

It's mainly used in:

| Platform | Contains SQLite |
|----------|-----------------|
| Mobile Devices | Every Android device, every iPhone and iOS device |
| Computers | Every Mac, every Windows 10 machine |
| Web Browsers | Every Firefox, Chrome, and Safari web browser |
| Communication Apps | Every Skype instance |
| Media Apps | Every iTunes instance, every Dropbox client |
| Financial Software | Every TurboTax and QuickBooks |
| Programming Languages | PHP and Python |
| Home Entertainment | Most televisions and set-top boxes |
| Automobiles | Most automotive multimedia systems |
| Others | Countless millions of other applications |

And SQLite's entire development team? Just three people:

- ***D. Richard Hipp***: **Started the SQLite project on May 29, 2000** and continues as the project architect. Richard was born in, lives in, and works in Charlotte, North Carolina. He holds a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Georgia Tech (1984) and a Ph.D. from Duke University (1992), and is the founder of the consulting firm Hwaci.
- ***Dan Kennedy***: An Australian currently living in Southeast Asia. He holds a degree in Computer Systems Engineering from the University of Queensland and has worked in various fields including industrial automation, computer graphics, and embedded software development. **Dan has been a major contributor to SQLite since 2002.**
- ***Joe Mistachkin*** (pronounced "miss-tash-kin"): A software engineer and one of the maintainers of Tcl/Tk. He is also the author of the TclBridge component and the Eagle scripting language. He has been in the software industry since 1994.

Another interesting fact is that SQLite doesn't accept any external code contributions.

In other words, SQLite is open source but not open to code contributions.

This is mentioned in SQLite's copyright statement:

Many times, we can't help but marvel at the **marginal cost of software**.

One piece of code can be distributed to ten people, or to **one billion people**.

Three developers supporting one trillion active uses.

The value created by SQLite is unparalleled. Technology changes the world.
