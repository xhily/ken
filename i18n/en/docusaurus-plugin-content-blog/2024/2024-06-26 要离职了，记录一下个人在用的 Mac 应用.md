## General Purpose
### Feishu

Believe it or not, the first recommendation is **Feishu**. It's the most comfortable project management application I've used.

Just **Feishu Docs** alone, its features and experience **far exceed** Tencent Docs, Shimo Docs, Yuque, and others on the market.

Now Feishu also supports **personal version**, no more thumbs up needed.

Besides documents, Feishu also supports email, video calls, and other features. Feishu = Enterprise WeChat + Tencent Docs + QQ Mail + Tencent Meeting, truly **All in One**.

Feishu also has some thoughtful small features, like **OCR (image to text), video recording, GIF recording**, and a very practical "**scrolling screenshot**" - no more worries about long screenshots.

### Arc

My main browser has switched from Chrome to **Arc**. Arc's **multiple spaces** solve my long-standing pain point.

It also automatically collapses expired tabs, **supports full screen, looks beautiful, and has comfortable interactions**. Arc is worth having.

### Youdao Translate

For programmers reading official technical documentation, **translation is a must**.

I'm a long-time user of Youdao Translate, accompanying it from Youdao Dictionary to its current name **Youdao Translate**.

Although Youdao's translation quality isn't the best, it wins with its **rich dictionary content and convenient hover translation**.

Now with AI added, translation quality has improved significantly. Got myself a two-year membership.

### Grammarly Desktop

When submitting issues or writing in English, worried about grammar mistakes? Grammarly Desktop comes in handy.

Basic **grammar checking is free**, but polishing and AI features require payment.

### iBar

My Mac has a notch screen. When there are too many apps, they get hidden by the notch, which is annoying.

iBar can collapse the menu bar.

### iShot

To capture beautiful screenshots **with rounded corners and shadows**, use iShot.

The free version is sufficient. Advanced paid features like long screenshots, OCR, and screen recording can be done with Feishu's built-in tools.

### Snipaste

When I switched from Windows to Mac, I continued using Snipaste. Its **pin image feature** is very useful.

### App Cleaner & Uninstaller

App Cleaner & Uninstaller for **thorough app uninstallation**, clean and complete.

### Runcat

Watching **a cat constantly running** in the menu bar is also a form of entertainment.

Runcat can display **current CPU usage** in the menu bar. The more CPU is used, the faster the cat runs.

### Activate Mac

A boring little widget, similar to Windows' "Activate Windows", displays "**Activate macOS**" in the bottom right corner of the screen.

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210643-sZCRev-df65d35512f54bacaff50c97e76a55b0.png)

## Productivity
### Personal Task Management Trio

1. TickTick: Task planning and scheduled tasks

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210643-1us241-4413626f2afa4ee0bce2c02bf23dffea.png)

2. Flomo: Recording inspiration, reviewing task processes or results

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210644-WxT4l6-56918f2910ce4913b91f46a1e127e6be.png)

3. FlowUs: Review output, reading notes

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210644-OAz4yK-c340a23af14b4e95a8c46d33b734f22a.png)

Why choose this toolkit?
1. All are domestic applications, no VPN needed, avoiding anxious moments during network fluctuations
2. Cross-platform support: mobile, PC, web, mini-programs - full coverage
3. Good to use, replacing Todoist, Notion, etc.

### Revezone

I often need to draw flowcharts and use Excalidraw for doodle-style drawings, but unfortunately it doesn't support Chinese fonts.

Revezone is like a localized version of Excalidraw, but goes further, integrating Tldraw, Notion-like note features, and providing a Mac client.

Currently open source and free, in alpha testing phase, worth trying.

### Screen Recording

1. OBS: **Professional recording**. Choose this for heavy-duty needs like course recording. For lightweight recording, use Feishu's GIF recording.

2. Screen Studio: Can create very smooth **operation videos**

3. KeyCastr: **Shows pressed keys**, open source and free

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210646-UYmWqE-ca3f7055bb1b439f8fe261663ed3d8d0.png)

### uTools

Truly a new generation efficiency tool platform. Everything is a plugin - whatever small feature you need can be found here.

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210647-G0gD5l-4417c34efa954d548b48a0bba8c683ca.png)

### Sunflower Remote Desktop

For remote computer access, I recommend Sunflower. The free version basically meets needs, though it pops up small ads.

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210647-g9Ckd5-d412bf92bf4f495a97d021029f4a4d43.png)

## Development

### Fork

A free **Git visualization tool**, aptly named "Fork".

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210648-4GzQpY-47e3688e9ce346d1a9d0bddb9a84118f.png)

### Warp

A new terminal application supporting basic **completion, memory** features, plus **AI assistance**.

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210649-E6kcQ2-7897db6aac2e4af38071913bd0ac10c1.png)

### Zed

I won't recommend JetBrains, VSCode, etc. - these are already well-known code editors.

I'll recommend **Zed**, a new generation editor based on Rust with **very fast startup and input speed**.

Zed is just starting out, worth watching.

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210650-AYMEK4-c085d2b1b9514e2082a6a4a7862859a1.png)

### Database Visualization

The database visualization king Navicat is familiar to everyone. **They finally released a free version called Navicat Premium Lite**. As a lite version of Navicat Premium 17, it has all the basic features.

Officially stated: "It meets the basic database management needs of beginners and non-commercial users" (probably because there were too many pirated copies ðŸ¤£)

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210650-eBj8QB-8e84b1dcb4464d0d9c1c09ae5f615a20.png)

If you only need lightweight database visualization, I recommend **SQL Pro Studio**.

While not as powerful as Navicat, it's a Mac **native app with good performance**. Basic operations (filtering, sorting) are covered, advanced features require writing SQL.

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210650-WJR0oz-4709cbe11acf40b1b18d95ff94936b77.png)

For Postgres databases, use Postico 2, **specifically for Postgres**.

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210651-7N6ZB4-47f982fb43da490d8f0a194e5ec3131e.png)

For Redis visualization, I recommend Another Redis Desktop Manager or Redis Insight. Each has pros and cons, can be used together.

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210651-0hoGFm-5a83331e65144994912b174052053ddb.png)

### Typora & uPic

When writing Markdown notes, Typora has always been my **first love**.

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com/2024/06/26-210652-zVksaN-e8ce678769dd46e08016711756b85e08.png)

Typora doesn't support images natively, so I set up an image hosting service on my server, currently **using uPic for image uploads**.

### He3

**Developer toolbox**, combining multiple development tools, plus some basic video editing, image cropping, audio conversion tools.
