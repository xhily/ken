Today I'd like to introduce Tristan, a developer who created an amazing Chinese traditional colors website.

Recently, I discovered another of his applications - a toolkit called **Sinqi Tools**.

Toolkit applications are already extremely competitive.

There's Raycast, He3, uTools, Alfred, DevToys, IT-Tools, and many more.

**sinqi.tools**, yet another toolkit application - why does it stand out?

Let's look at some official examples:

It has two main characteristics:

One is its vertical focus - **specifically for frontend developers and designers**

The other is **refinement** - aesthetics is the primary productivity

Let's compare it with IT-Tools:

A rough palate can't appreciate fine grain - Sinqi better captures the frontend developer's taste.

For frontend developers, useful tools include:
- Code generation: Code Converter, Code Beautifier, Tailwind Background, CSS Generator, Sunburst Maker, Wave Maker, etc.

- Network tools: URL Parser, Query IP, HTTP Status Code, etc.

- Image processing: Code Image, Image Editor, QRCode Generator, etc.

Besides these, there are some interesting small tools, like Avatar (avatar generation):

Currently, Sinqi is still in Beta stage, with some obvious issues.

One is the limited number of tools, another is that some basic functions have problems, like some tools lacking Chinese language support, no back button, etc.

Regarding Sinqi's future development, developer Tristan stated he will continue maintaining "**user-friendly interaction, clean interface**"
