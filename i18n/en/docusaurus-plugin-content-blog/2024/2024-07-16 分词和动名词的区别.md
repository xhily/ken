1. **Present Participle**: Verbs ending in "-ing", such as "running".
   - Example: The running water is cold.

2. **Past Participle**: The past participle form of verbs, such as "eaten".
   - Example: The broken vase was expensive.

### Gerund
A gerund also ends in "-ing", but it functions as a noun, representing an action or activity.
- Example: Running is good for health.

### Differences

   - **Participle**: Used to describe nouns or pronouns, functioning as an adjective.
