title: Are Programmer-Specific Coding Monitors a False Need?
unlisted: true
---

They say **programmers' money is the hardest to earn**. I think this should be taken as a compliment - naturally inclined to tinker, willing to invest time and energy to find the optimal solution between quality, price, and needs.

For programmers, the three most essential items are: computers, keyboards/mice, and monitors.

Regarding monitors, I've long wondered: programmers have such strong monitor needs, but there don't seem to be monitors specifically designed for programmers on the market? If there were, what would they look like? Would such monitors be real productivity tools or false needs? Let's see what the RD280U has to offer.

## Large Screen

The most immediate impact of the RD280U is its 3:2 large display size:

Compared to regular 16:9 monitors, the RD280U's large screen is **physically taller**, accommodating more lines of code with significantly less scrolling needed (spare my mouse hand).

For those used to 16:9, the 3:2 aspect ratio might feel odd initially, but you get used to it quickly. And following the law of "really fragrant", whether ~~copying~~ writing code or reading technical documentation, the large screen is obviously advantageous.

To clarify, **large screen doesn't mean tall screen**. During my senior year, I tried turning a 16:9 monitor vertical - while it increased height, the width became too narrow. Good for code, uncomfortable for documentation. BenQ RD280U's innovative 3:2 ratio strikes a balance.

## Code Display

As a long-term developer, I never considered code display before, but RD280U clearly has. On the 4K screen, they've specifically enhanced code display with programming color modes - light and dark themes to match different code backgrounds. No matter your preferred programming background, code appears clear and refined. Extended viewing no longer causes the dry, sore eyes I experienced before:

Both dark and light modes work perfectly - my eyes immediately felt more comfortable.

## Anti-Reflective Panel

I have a desk lamp in front of my desk, which previously caused annoying reflections on my monitor. The RD280U has an anti-reflective coating on the screen, greatly reducing reflections with zero glare. As you can see below, the code remains clearly visible:

Compare this to a Mac without anti-reflective coating:

## Cool Moonhalo Lighting

Who can resist an RD280U with a glowing back? Especially at night, coding with this ambiance is incredibly cool:

The glow comes from the Moonhalo light ring on the back. "Moon" means moon, and "halo" is Spanish for "hello" - a **beautiful name**.

## Physical Buttons

BenQ RD280U supports comprehensive physical button controls, which is standard:

Beyond basics, RD280U supports one-button `</>` switching between different display modes. Touch the function bar below the screen to quickly switch modes - very convenient:

## Display Pilot 2

What surprised me is that the monitor comes with comprehensive software - [Display Pilot 2](https://www.benq.com/en-us/support/downloads-faq/products/monitor/display-pilot-2/software-driver.html). The UI is flawless and fully featured.

Moonhalo lights up on command, color modes switch freely, and you can set hotkeys to directly switch monitor modes, etc. The RD280U is really scoring big points here.

Without working at a hardware company, you might not understand - these companies usually focus on hardware with software as an afterthought or non-existent. **BenQ's emphasis on supporting software development is truly rare and commendable**.

## Summary

As a programmer-specific coding monitor, I'd give the BenQ RD280U 90 points. The oversized screen makes viewing code and documentation super convenient. Clear, distinguishable code display physically enhances your IDE. Other features like Moonhalo lighting, comprehensive physical buttons, supporting software, and unmentioned features like KVM multi-host switching, Rheinland-certified eye protection, MST multi-stream transport, etc., all hit programmers' pain points and sweet spots. It's like enabling "do not disturb" mode - focus and work efficiency get a massive boost, directly liberating productivity! You deserve it!
