title: It's Almost 2025, I Won't Let You Not Know This AI Reading Tool
---

Recently, a friend asked me: what software can **translate PDF documents into Chinese?**

That stumped me for a moment. I usually only use simple Q&A AIs like ChatGPT, Kimi, or Doubao. For **actual PDF document translation scenarios, I hadn't encountered that**.

In the end, my friend had to pay for it on Xiaohongshu, spending 50 yuan ðŸ’°

Because I didn't know how to use AI, I actually missed a money-making opportunity!

Fortunately, I recently discovered an intelligent AI reading assistant called "[Baoyue AI](https://baoyueai.com/home/scenes?utm_id=237648#part-8)".

Testing it with a PDF document, the translation results were quite impressive:

Not only that, clicking to generate a mind map, a **clearly structured mind map appears beautifully**:

Moreover, Baoyue AI also **automatically generated a summary**:

Besides PDF documents, it also supports word, ppt, epub, mobi, txt, markdown, jpg/png, webp, wps, caj, and even video and audio files.

To help me read documents easily, Baoyue AI really went the extra mile.

Baoyue has a deep understanding of current AI large language model capabilities.

Current large models are actually **not good at generating information** - asking them to write articles just results in repetitive content going in circles.

But when it comes to deconstructing and understanding information, they excel.

Baoyue leverages AI's strengths, **maximizing the advantages in deconstructing and understanding information**.

In terms of specific product implementation, Baoyue does several things:

First, through easy-to-understand "reading scenarios" categorization, **letting users quickly match their needs**.

Current scenarios include academic papers, contracts, office work, self-media, teaching assistant, books, official documents, technical R&D, etc., **meeting most requirements**.

For example, recently while learning Coco's "CSS Technology Decryption and Practical Mastery", I used "Technical R&D > Line-by-line Code Explanation".

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com//2024/10/24-233010-xxu7qV-1f176d24d4444a3cbbf1bedf24e8a664-20241024233010292.png)

Line-by-line explanation of all CSS code properties, learning efficiency Max ðŸ’ª

Second is rich information processing methods - it's not just a chatbot.

For example, using the "Self-media > Tech News Deep Reading" scenario, I had Baoyue analyze this article ["Can Zed Beat VS Code?"](https://wukaipeng.com/blog/zed)

![](https://img.wukaipeng.com//2024/10/23-213117-fmrs1L-8f0b4378f2ec488aac6d396bbe0cdac0.png)

Besides the mind map mentioned earlier, there's also an introduction to help users **quickly understand the article's core points**, as well as rewriting features for **secondary creation** and more.

Third is adding "AI Search" to let users **connect to more related information** - external enhancement.

Fourth is having "note-taking capabilities", allowing users to **record their divergent thoughts** - internal enhancement.

Through this four-in-one approach, closing the entire loop from need identification, information processing, information expansion, to information digestion, **perfectly solving reading scenarios**.

I sincerely hope that domestic companies developing AI applications can be like Baoyue AI, **truly focusing on and perfecting a vertical scenario**, improving efficiency and saving time for users, creating real value.
