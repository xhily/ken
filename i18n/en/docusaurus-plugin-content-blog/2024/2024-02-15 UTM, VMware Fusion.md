Fusion has excellent support for Windows 11, but doesn't support other versions.

Here I recommend **UTM**. This is UTM running Windows 7:

UTM is also a free virtual system software.

UTM installation is quite simple.

First download the desired image. Images can be downloaded from MSDN ðŸ‘‰ https://msdn.itellyou.cn

Then download the corresponding configuration file from UTM https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/

After downloading, you'll get a file with .utm extension, then open that file.

After opening, you need to change the system image path.

In the upper right corner, change it to the corresponding downloaded system image:
