title: "Beautiful, Functional + Free AI-Powered Terminal Tool: Recommending Warp"
---

Recently, Warp has gained quite a reputation, with many people recommending this terminal tool, so I decided to download and try it out.

After several days of in-depth experience, the conclusion is that **it can indeed replace my previous iTerm**.

Warp has good aesthetics, looks comfortable, and satisfies the fancy requirements of frontend engineers.

There are **multiple themes** to choose from:

Warp directly provides **command prompt** functionality, without the hassle required with iTerm:

The best feature, of course, is the AI capability. You can open "**Warp AI**" in the upper right corner. If you forget a command, you can chat directly:

For Free users, you get **20 free queries per day**, which is sufficient for personal use:

Warp also provides "**Warp Drive**", which allows you to **save and share** commands within your team:

Currently, Warp **only supports Mac and Linux**, but Windows support is coming soon:
