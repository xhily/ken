title: Thoughts on Tencent QQ Browser Copying Arc

Today I saw on a Reddit post that QQ Browser has copied Arc.

And it was even posted by Arc officials.

> It looks very similar lol

I was a bit shocked. With doubts, I opened the QQ Browser official website.

After downloading and opening it:

After looking around, I didn't see anything similar to Arc.

QQ Browser is more like a Chrome skin.

Maybe it's not Mac? I looked again.

Oh, it's Windows.

I went to my Windows virtual machine and downloaded the Windows version of QQ Browser.

There's a "horizontal/vertical" switch button in the upper left corner.

Let's make a rough comparison.

**Vertical screen logic** - QQ is basically consistent with Arc:

QQ

Arc

**Split screen mode** - Arc veteran users clearly know that the three-dot menu in the upper right is Arc's old interaction:

Arc

**Sidebar collapse** - QQ still doesn't dare to go full screen, leaving a sidebar:

Arc

**Bookmarking websites** - Both QQ and Arc allow bookmarking at the top of the sidebar:

Arc

Apart from these similarities between QQ Browser and Arc, things like bookmarks and search input are actually different.

What's disappointing is that QQ Browser doesn't have Arc's killer feature - "Spaces".

The interaction animations and color schemes also fail to achieve Arc's smooth and comfortable feel.

QQ Browser's vertical mode can only be considered a **budget version of Arc**.

In the comments section, there was this statement:

> I'll take a hot guess that this is a Chinese company. China does not care about foreign copyright law in the slightest.

Although both are based on Chromium, Arc has its own unique understanding of browsers.

They've restructured traditional bookmark and page interactions, providing key features like split screen, multiple spaces, etc.

Domestic companies following browser product innovation should have been encouraging.

But directly copying like QQ Browser does is truly harmful to innovation.
