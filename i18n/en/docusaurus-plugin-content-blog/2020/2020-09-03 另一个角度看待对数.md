I never quite understood **logarithms** $log$ before. Recently I saw another interpretation of logarithms in "Grokking Algorithms" that was quite interesting, so I'm recording it here. For example, given a logarithm:

$$
log_28
$$

It can be viewed as **how many 2s multiplied together equal 8**. The answer is of course 3, since $2^3=8$:

$$
2\times2\times2=8
$$

The above perspective focuses on the base. To generalize further, if we focus on the argument, it can also be viewed as **8 divided by how many 2s equals 1**:

$$
8\div2\div2\div2=1
$$
