# English Capitalization Rules Guide

Whether in daily writing, creating Pull Requests, or submitting Issues to open source projects, we often need to use English titles. Knowing which parts require capitalization can be quite troublesome. Below are detailed English capitalization rules from Scribendi, a team with over 20 years of experience in editing and proofreading English works and documents. Their capitalization rules incorporate standards from Chicago, MLA, and APA style guides, making them extremely valuable for reference.

Names of people, places, and specific objects and events should be capitalized:

Example:
- The **Burj Khalifa** is the tallest tower in the world.
- In China, the **Dragon Boat Festival** is celebrated in late June.

## 2. Seasons, Months, Directions üçÉ

Seasons used alone do not need capitalization, but when combined with specific names or events, they should be capitalized.

## 6. Work Titles üìö
