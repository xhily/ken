title: "Simple Distinction Between Concurrency and Parallelism"
---

When I first started learning about concurrency and parallelism, I always got a bit confused. Now I'm finally taking the time to properly clarify the relationship between the two.

First, the word for concurrency is "Concurrency". The root "con-" means "together", and the root "current-" means "current", so the overall meaning is "things happening together".

The word for parallelism is "Parallelism". The root "parallel-" means parallel or side by side, so the overall meaning is "things happening in parallel", which can also be said as "things happening simultaneously".

Here's a vivid example mentioned by a Zhihu answerer:
> You're eating a meal when the phone rings. You wait until you finish eating before answering. This means you support neither concurrency nor parallelism.
> 
> You're eating a meal when the phone rings. You stop to answer the phone, then continue eating after the call. This means you support concurrency.

> You're eating a meal when the phone rings. You answer the phone while continuing to eat. This means you support parallelism.
> 
> The key to concurrency is having the ability to handle multiple tasks, not necessarily simultaneously. The key to parallelism is having the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. So I think the most crucial point is: whether it's **simultaneous**.

From this Zhihu answerer, we can actually understand that: **parallelism is a special case of concurrency**.
Concurrency only requires the ability to handle multiple tasks, while parallelism requires the ability to handle multiple tasks **simultaneously**.

With this in mind, let's clarify the concurrency and parallelism of multi-core and single-core CPUs.

First, for single-core CPUs: A single-core CPU is very clear - it can only do one thing at a time, so it cannot have parallelism, but it may have concurrency (if this CPU supports the ability to handle multiple tasks).

Second, for multi-core CPUs: Multi-core CPUs are composed of multiple single-core CPUs, so handling multiple tasks at the same time becomes effortless, thus having parallelism (having parallelism means definitely having concurrency, as we've already said parallelism is a special case of concurrency).
