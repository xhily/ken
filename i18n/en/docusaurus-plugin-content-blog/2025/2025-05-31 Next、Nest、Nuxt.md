title: Who Can Tell the Difference Between Next.js, Nest.js, and Nuxt.js?
---

As a frontend developer, at least once in your career or studies, you'll encounter a situation where you need to distinguish between **Next.js**, **Nest.js**, and **Nuxt.js**.

I just had one of these moments recently.

A new colleague joined our company, and during lunch chat, I heard him mention he had worked on **Next.js** projects before.

Since our company's new project is based on Next.js, I thought, "Great! Our new project is saved!"

But later in the group chat, he clarified that he had actually worked on **Nest.js** projects.

That really threw me off.

As an ordinary developer speaking ordinary Mandarin, it's completely normal not to be able to distinguish between the pronunciations of Next /nekst/ and Nest /nest/.

The authors who named these frameworks were really "clever."

These names are like wholesale products - all following the pattern N__t.js. The last time I was this confused was with the jewelry brands "Chow Tai Fook, Chow Luk Fook, Chow Sang Sang, Luk Fook Jewellery..."

This **brand piggybacking** actually peaked around 2016 when frontend frameworks were exploding.

That was a time when the frontend industry was blooming with various frameworks emerging constantly.

On October 25, 2016, Next.js 1.0 was released, making its debut as an open-source project.

Next.js is based on the React framework, providing Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) capabilities, along with features like automatic code splitting and routing systems.

Just one day later, on October 26, Nuxt.js was released.

I have to say, Nuxt.js copied really fast - it's based on Vue.js and created another version of Next.js.

Nest.js came later, releasing on February 26, 2017. It's quite different from Next.js and Nuxt.js.

It's a pure Node.js backend framework - essentially the JavaScript world's Spring Boot.

All three frameworks are doing well now. Besides their own technical merits, could their success be partly due to their **"trend-riding"** names?

Maybe next time when developing a new framework, we should just call it **Not.js**.
